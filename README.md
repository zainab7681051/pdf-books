# Pizza Delievry
Vuejs 3 web application for pizzerias. The graphic designs on the frontend are in  HTML/CSS with vue framework, and Google's firebase cloud services were used. Cloud firestore and authentication tools were used for getting/putting data to/from the cloud and registering and logging in the users.
## NOTE: Google sign-in provider was enabled for this project, though firebase offers many more providers, e.g., facebook, twitter, anonymous user(users who choose to create account), etc...
